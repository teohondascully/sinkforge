# Decisions ledger

Append-only. Every judgment call not dictated by a normative doc, logged when made, not at session
end. Four lines: decided, alternative, why, reverse cost. Test: would a competent engineer with these
documents have plausibly chosen differently? If yes, it belongs here. `CONTEXT.md`, "Review bandwidth."

## D0001 · 2026-08-26 · docs/GDD.md §8
Decided: Draft A's run curve is 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 18, 25, 35, 42 minutes across 9 runs (~2.5h total).
Alternative: any other escalating shape landing in the stated 8-12 runs / 2-3h envelope — this exact
sequence is one plausible fit among many.
Why: preserves the original curve's escalating shape and front-loaded-cadence argument while landing
inside the revised total. Not derived from anything more principled than "a plausible compression";
flagging in case the director wants a different specific shape.
Reverse: CHEAP — prose numbers, nothing built against them yet.

## D0002 · 2026-08-26 · docs/GDD.md §5, §10
Decided: extended the run-curve revision beyond §8 into the worked examples in §5 ("Run 12"/"Run 30" →
"Run 5"/"Run 9") and §10 ("Run 25" → "Run 9"), which the instruction to update the curve didn't name
explicitly.
Alternative: leave those examples untouched and let them go stale against the new 9-run arc.
Why: leaving them would put two irreconcilable claims about total run count in the same document —
exactly the kind of internal contradiction this project treats as a defect, not a style choice.
Reverse: CHEAP — prose only.

## D0003 · 2026-08-26 · sim/commands/MODULE.md, sim/run/MODULE.md
Decided: the Freight Winch gate note goes in both MODULE.md files, not just one.
Alternative: `sim/commands` only, the closer analog to the pre-pivot entry point where the mechanic
regrew ad hoc.
Why: haul mechanics plausibly touch both the command vocabulary and run lifecycle; a reader consulting
only one module shouldn't miss the gate.
Reverse: CHEAP — delete a paragraph from either file.

## D0004 · 2026-08-26 · core/ — NOT DECIDED, stopped per instruction
Not decided: fixed-point representation for state-affecting positions and velocities.
Existing spec: `core/MODULE.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4 both already say i32, 16 fractional bits —
written during Task 0 skeleton scaffolding, before this specific range question was checked. i32 (not
i64) is well-motivated independent of range: it makes fixed-point multiply safe using GDScript's native
64-bit int as the intermediate (i32 × i32 always fits in 64 bits; i64 × i64 would need 128-bit
intermediates GDScript doesn't have). That part looks right and isn't in question.
What's actually unresolved: 16 fractional bits leaves 15 magnitude bits, so position range is ±32,767 in
whatever unit "position" is stored in. Two facts needed to validate that range are not written down
anywhere I can find: (1) the pixels-per-meter (or equivalent) conversion between GDD's narrative depth
in meters and the position unit body/world actually use — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9 names 1px/2-4px/16px
as resolution levels but never states a scale constant, and legacy's old `CELL: int = 32` doesn't carry
over as a stated decision; (2) a maximum playable depth — `docs/GDD.md` §11 states depth is "continuous
and always increasing" with no ceiling, by design. Without both, ±32,767 units cannot be checked against
the depth range "we need," which is exactly the check requested. A chunked/relative coordinate scheme
(position relative to a region origin, sidestepping global range entirely) is a plausible alternative
that would change what "range" even means here, and isn't something to adopt unilaterally either.
Reverse: N/A — nothing implemented. `core/fixed_point.gd` (or equivalent) is not written this session.
Blocks: `sim/body`, `sim/transport`, and any other position/velocity state, but not RNG or generational
IDs, which don't depend on it — proceeding with those instead.

## D0005 · 2026-08-26 · core/split_rng.gd
Decided: SplitMix64 (Vigna) as the RNG algorithm, verified bit-exact in GDScript against a from-scratch
Python reference before writing any test around it (golden vectors regenerated, not remembered).
Alternative: xorshift128+, PCG32, or a Godot-builtin-seeded `RandomNumberGenerator` wrapper.
Why: four operations, no internal array/table state (the entire state is one int, trivial to serialize
per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4's "streams are serialized state"), and its structure makes advancing the
stream and deriving a child stream the same primitive operation, which is what `split()` needed. Not
cryptographically secure and nothing here needs that. Godot's built-in RNG was rejected specifically
because its algorithm isn't part of the engine's documented determinism contract — this project pins
the engine version for reproducibility and shouldn't also depend on an internal implementation detail
that could change between patch releases without notice.
Reverse: EXPENSIVE once anything depends on specific drawn values (a recorded replay log, a scenario
fixture) — cheap right now, before either exists.

## D0006 · 2026-08-26 · core/split_rng.gd
Decided: `split(label)` derives from the stream's ROOT seed, not its current draw position, and passes
the result through one extra SplitMix64 step rather than using the raw XOR of root-seed and label-hash
directly.
Alternative: derive from current mutable state (simpler, but makes split() results depend on call order
and how many draws happened first — a stream saved/restored mid-run could then produce different children
than the same stream that never paused, which would be a determinism trap of exactly the kind this
project exists to avoid); or skip the extra mixing step (cheaper, but a family of labels differing by one
bit would produce correlated children).
Why: order-independence is worth one extra operation. Verified in the same test suite that split() gives
identical results regardless of how many draws preceded the call.
Reverse: CHEAP — nothing consumes split() output for real yet.

## D0007 · 2026-08-26 · core/entity_id_pool.gd
Decided: an entity id is one packed 64-bit int, `(generation << 32) | index`, not a two-field object.
Alternative: a small `RefCounted`-based `EntityId` class with `index`/`generation` fields and an
`equals()` method.
Why: GDScript objects compare by reference, not value, so two `EntityId` instances representing "the
same" id would need a custom equals() everywhere instead of plain `==`, and couldn't be used as
dictionary keys directly. A packed int sidesteps both for free and serializes as one integer, which
matches "generational-index entity IDs... Never pointers, never bare array positions"
(`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4) more literally than an object would. 32 bits per field is not a limit this
project will hit.
Reverse: EXPENSIVE once any sim/ module stores ids in serialized state or as struct fields — cheap now,
nothing does yet. The release operation is named `release()`, not `free()` — `Object.free()` is inherited
by every GDScript class and the collision is a parse error, not a silent shadow, but the name is worth
getting right the first time rather than colliding with it in a dozen call sites later.

## D0008 · 2026-08-26 · HARD STOP — gate red, not fixable in one attempt within scope
Not decided: nothing. `SplitRng` and `EntityIdPool` (152 lines, `core/`) plus their tests (249 lines,
`tests/`) are complete, mutation-tested, and staged, but NOT committed — `check_loc_ratio.py` FAILs
(instrument 1112 > game 152) and this is the hard stop the autonomous-session grant named explicitly:
"any gate red you cannot make green in one attempt — revert, log, stop."
This is not a bug in the new code or a miscalibrated gate. `tools/` alone is 863 lines, built in Task 0
before any game code existed, specifically because `docs/ONBOARDING.md` Task 0.6 required the gates to
exist before core/ or sim/ did. 863 already exceeds any plausible size for `core/` on its own — "small,
pure," per this module's own MODULE.md — so this gate was arithmetically guaranteed to flip from its
bootstrap WARN to a real FAIL the moment ANY code landed in `core/` without `sim/` also landing enough
LOC alongside it. That is exactly what this autonomous grant's stage boundary does: stop before stage 3
(`sim/world`, `sim/terrain_gen`), which is where most real "game" LOC would come from. The gate's own
source comment anticipated this precisely: "This WARN must stop being silent the moment Task 1 lands
core/... it should be treated as a FAIL by hand until then" — it did exactly what it was built to do.
The two ways to make it green — shrink `tests/` to reduce instrument LOC, or write `sim/` code to grow
game LOC — are both worse than leaving it red: the first trades away real correctness assurance on
bit-manipulation code specifically chosen because it's easy to get subtly wrong, to satisfy a proxy
metric (exactly the "claim-as-paperwork" failure class this project's culture exists to avoid); the
second crosses the stage-3 boundary the grant drew on purpose ("stage 3 starts making judgment calls...
I want to be present for those").
Reverse: N/A — nothing committed, nothing reverted. The 152+249 lines exist on disk, staged, for review;
git history is untouched past commit `b45510f`.
Blocks: this session's remaining commit budget. Stage 2 (`replay_determinism_test`) is not attempted —
it would only add more `tests/` LOC against the same still-tiny `core/`, worsening the same red rather
than working around it.

## D0004 — RESOLVED, 2026-08-26
The director supplied both missing constants directly: world scale 16px = 1m (= the machine/logic
cell), terrain grid 4px, max playable depth 4096px (256m). i32/16-fractional-bits checked against them
in `docs/adr/0003-fixed-point-representation.md` and confirmed far from binding (8x range headroom,
precision several orders finer than anything that consumes it). `core/fixed_point.gd` implements
exactly this format. This entry is not edited above — D0004 is left as the honest record of what was
unknown at the time; this is the follow-up, not a correction of it.

## D0009 · 2026-08-26 · core/fixed_point.gd
Decided: `Fx.isqrt()` uses Newton's method (Heron's method) on plain non-negative integers, verified
against Python's `math.isqrt` for 27 values including 0, 1, perfect squares, and random values up to
2^47 before being trusted.
Alternative: a bit-by-bit binary digit-extraction integer sqrt (the classic hardware-style algorithm),
or a fixed iteration count instead of convergence-based termination.
Why: Newton's method for integer sqrt converges monotonically and terminates in a handful of iterations
for any input in this project's actual range; it's fewer lines and easier to verify by hand than the
bit-by-bit form, and termination-by-convergence (rather than a fixed iteration count) means it's
correct rather than "correct enough after N steps" — no separate argument needed for why N is enough.
Reverse: CHEAP — nothing outside `core/` calls it yet, and both algorithms produce the same output for
the same input by construction (floor(sqrt(x))), so swapping is a drop-in replacement if a performance
reason ever justifies it.

## D0010 · 2026-08-26 · core/fixed_point.gd
Decided: `Fx.div(a, b)` with `b == 0` returns 0 and logs via `push_error()`, rather than letting
GDScript's `/` raise.
Alternative: return a saturated sentinel (max/min i32 depending on the sign of `a`), or let it raise and
require every caller to pre-check `b != 0` themselves.
Why: an unguarded `/` by zero doesn't crash the process in a bare `--headless --script` run — it HANGS,
because the runtime script error aborts execution before `quit()` is ever reached, and nothing catches
it (GDScript has no try/catch). Verified empirically before writing this entry, not assumed; see
`core/MODULE.md`'s Gotchas for the general statement. A hang is strictly worse than a wrong-but-visible
return value for a test suite or CI job, so returning 0 (loud in the log, not fatal to the run) was
chosen over both letting it raise and over a saturating sentinel, which would be quieter about a real
bug than an explicit error log is.
Reverse: CHEAP — one function, no caller depends on the specific sentinel value yet.

## D0011 · 2026-08-26 · core/fixed_point.gd
Decided: `Fx.length()`/`Fx.length_sq()` are scoped explicitly as LOCAL-neighborhood primitives (safe to
~181px per axis, documented and demonstrated by a test that shows the exact wraparound point), not
extended to handle arbitrary world-scale distances.
Alternative: widen the intermediate (accumulate the squared terms in a wider format before reducing) so
the function is safe across the full ~2048m depth budget.
Why: named need was "distance" for `sim/body`/`sim/transport`, which is collision-adjacent and
inherently local (nearest-neighbor checks, per-tick movement deltas) — never a distance query spanning
a meaningful fraction of the world. Building a world-scale-safe version now would be exactly the
"square roots beyond what collision needs" the autonomous grant named as a stop condition, for a need
nothing currently has. Documented precisely instead of built defensively.
Reverse: EXPENSIVE once something calls `length()` on a delta anywhere near 181px and gets silently
wrong output — this is the specific risk the doc comment and the boundary test exist to prevent, but a
reverse (widening the intermediate) would still just be adding to the same file, not restructuring it.
