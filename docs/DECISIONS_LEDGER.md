# Decisions ledger

Append-only. Every judgment call not dictated by a normative doc, logged when made, not at session
end. Four lines: decided, alternative, why, reverse cost. Test: would a competent engineer with these
documents have plausibly chosen differently? If yes, it belongs here. `CONTEXT.md`, "Review bandwidth."

## D0001 · 2026-08-26 · docs/GDD.md §8
Decided: Draft A's run curve is 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 18, 25, 35, 42 minutes across 9 runs (~2.5h total).
Alternative: any other escalating shape landing in the stated 8-12 runs / 2-3h envelope — this exact
sequence is one plausible fit among many.
Why: preserves the original curve's escalating shape and front-loaded-cadence argument while landing
inside the revised total. Not derived from anything more principled than "a plausible compression";
flagging in case the director wants a different specific shape.
Reverse: CHEAP — prose numbers, nothing built against them yet.

## D0002 · 2026-08-26 · docs/GDD.md §5, §10
Decided: extended the run-curve revision beyond §8 into the worked examples in §5 ("Run 12"/"Run 30" →
"Run 5"/"Run 9") and §10 ("Run 25" → "Run 9"), which the instruction to update the curve didn't name
explicitly.
Alternative: leave those examples untouched and let them go stale against the new 9-run arc.
Why: leaving them would put two irreconcilable claims about total run count in the same document —
exactly the kind of internal contradiction this project treats as a defect, not a style choice.
Reverse: CHEAP — prose only.

## D0003 · 2026-08-26 · sim/commands/MODULE.md, sim/run/MODULE.md
Decided: the Freight Winch gate note goes in both MODULE.md files, not just one.
Alternative: `sim/commands` only, the closer analog to the pre-pivot entry point where the mechanic
regrew ad hoc.
Why: haul mechanics plausibly touch both the command vocabulary and run lifecycle; a reader consulting
only one module shouldn't miss the gate.
Reverse: CHEAP — delete a paragraph from either file.
