# Brief

**Last updated: 2026-09-07.** Repository cleanup Batches 1–2, starting at `61b50fa4`; D0480.

## Delivered

Public setup and build status now describe the implemented game and missing rig economy.
Onboarding no longer instructs a new agent to repeat the pivot.
C003 remains BLOCKED with current dependencies, rather than claiming saves and interfaces do not exist.
WORKING is a short current-state page. BACKLOG routes work to existing P/T/V records.
Five prior operational documents and the preceding gameplay brief are preserved under
`docs/archive/cleanup-2026-09-07/`. No code, tests, historical evidence, or gameplay rules were removed.

## Verification

- The documented item-suite command passed 78 assertions under Godot 4.6.2.
- Schema validation, generated-data freshness, working-date and ledger integrity checks passed.
- CI non-shrink check passed: no jobs, suites, or enforcing steps removed.
- The five operational snapshots match their source at 61b50fa4.
- Local documentation links and diff whitespace checked.
- Claim-reference check reports VOID (no claim-linked scenarios); it is not proof of a measured claim.
- Gate-status completed but found no completed CI run for the starting HEAD, so remote outcomes
  are UNKNOWN. Its initial untracked-doc failure was resolved by staging and rerunning that check.
  Its Linux display-install step fails on this macOS host. No full CI pass is claimed.

## What was learned

The suite runners already share CI-derived selection; another suite list would duplicate the solution.
Gate-status actively executes checks and repeats local step resolution, including mutation sweeps.
This is concrete avoidable overhead, now a Batch 3 item. Engineering's percentage split remains an
estimate; measure implementation, model waits, simulation/capture, verification and documentation
separately before changing orchestration.

## Next

Batch 3: harness/test/tool organization and module contracts, with gate-report deduplication a
bounded first candidate. [Cleanup plan](CLEANUP_PLAN.md) records scope and acceptance.
Gameplay continuation remains the forge checkpoint and subsequent opening rungs; see the
[preserved gameplay brief](archive/cleanup-2026-09-07/BRIEF.md).

## Gameplay (the engineering session, 2026-09-07 night; D0482–D0487)

**The opening is the spec's loop now.** The director's contract (D0482, after Astra's audit): fuel-fed
forge, dug supply, rig demand; the free drill, the coal-free smelt and the wood rung named as legacy
fixture behaviour and removed. Built: `smelt_ingot` is 2 ore + 1 coal, the need bubble names what a
machine lacks, a drill lets one coal fall with its stream when the machine below wants it (D0483); the
crew's rig -- a machine, the demand ladder as data (`data/progression/d1.yaml`: two ingots buy the drill),
its runner, `stage` through the save (D0484, `tests/test_rig.gd`); the rig in a well two metres right of
the spawn, no drill pile, the sinkhole mouth capped four metres wide, deliver in place of wood, the guide
rings the rig then the drill at its foot (D0485); the smelt ring goes to the coal seam until coal is
carried (D0486); a stranger's command returns the screenshot and the clock only (D0487). The scripted
witness plays the new opening in 17.7 s (ore 1.3, coal 3.4, two ingots 9.6, the drill in hand 17.7; set in
the shaft 4.2 s later). The playthrough suite drives all six rungs through the door.

**The one batch (70-75, six seats, all VALID):** ore 6 of 6, smelt 0 of 6. The build's smelt how-to had
run to a third line and lost "press Q" to the ellipsis (CI's objective-line suite caught it; fixed
8c6fc9f4); three of six never found the coal seam (D0486 answers); one fed the rig. The next batch
measures the fixed label and the seam ring together, after the next discoverability change.

**For the director:** D2–D6's rewards (a data diff each); a machine's need-bubble while another is ringed
(the rig asked for ingots during the smelt rung, the shaft forge during 67-69); the stride; the seam's size
and colour (one black metre at +5 reads as shadow). **Verification cadence:** touched suites locally, gates
once a push, the battery on CI. **Next:** the refusal slot (a short press's refusal seen on screen), the
reticle-versus-effective-cell check, then D2 and the first rig reward beyond the drill.
